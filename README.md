Overview
Auction Now aims to act as an intermediate platform to bring a comfortable experience of participating in online auctions to all types of users. The pages are simple and intuitive with clear functionality. Different customer types can meet their needs from the system. Customers can auction and be auctioned their collection online, with no restrictions on time or location, enabling wider participation in bidding. As online auctions generally last longer, they can attract a wider range of customers.
